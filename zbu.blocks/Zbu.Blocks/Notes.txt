Install-Package Newtonsoft.Json -Version 4.5.11
=> use the same version Umbraco 6.2 uses


STATUS
- rendering is working
- still issue with the controller, will kick in all situations, would want to filter (factory?)
- must cleanup the controller, implement fragments and block types

TODO

- AJAX & MOBILE
	structures support contexts
	controller should set contexts? ie for AJAX? that should be a local thing really...
	  => controller should be overridable

- Fragment
    code the handling of the fragment in RenderingBlock
	prob. need a block.fragmentType field to indicate the content type of the fragment

- Block types
    via a config file
	implement

- do we want partial structures on children (what is this)?

- What's in a block
    find a way to indicate that a block's sub-blocks are columns
	via a block.layout field?

	do we want to restrict the list of block name/source/whatever that can appear under a given block?
	do we need block types to handle all this?
